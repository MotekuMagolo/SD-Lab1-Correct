# What I Learned

Through this web development journey, I mastered Git version control including cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing to GitHub. I implemented semantic HTML using meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` for better accessibility and SEO. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with CSS Flexbox for creating responsive layouts and deployed my first live website using GitHub Pages.

This comprehensive practice taught me the complete workflow from local development to production deployment, giving me confidence in real-world web development scenarios
